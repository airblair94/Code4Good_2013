The project was an attempt to streamline and digitize the process used by the Milford Housing Development Corporation (a nonprofit based in Delaware).
We attempted to increase the efficiency of the paper-based application system they used by allowing clients the ability
to apply online and view their application.

While we didn't achieve everything we sought to do simply because of time constraints, we completed a functional base program that 
could be easily expanded and scaled as the nonprofit grew.
